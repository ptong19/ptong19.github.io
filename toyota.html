                    <p>Overview
                            The original Prius helped make hybrid vehicles mainstream back in the early 2000s, and it continues to be one of the most recognized hybrid nameplates. Its eccentric exterior styling and—ahem—untraditional interior design are unmistakable albeit polarizing. Still, the Toyota has always been about making the world a greener place by maximizing fuel economy and minimizing emissions. The compact hatchback is losing ground to newer hybrid alternatives such as the Hyundai Ioniq and the Kia Niro, but the Toyota brand maintains an unrivaled reputation for reliability. While the Prius is the polar opposite of driving enjoyment and high performance (or any type of performance, for that matter), its comfortable interior and trademark powertrain deliver what many consumers want.
                            Highs: Available all-wheel drive, extraordinarily efficient, cedes no storage space to its battery pack. 
                            Lows: Wacky exterior design, underwhelming interior trimmings, a new low for slow. 
                            Verdict: The Prius delivers on its eco-friendly image, but there's now more to life in the hybrid lane than mpg alone.
